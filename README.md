# 🌌 NEBULARK

**Nebulark** is a multiplayer, procedurally generated survival sandbox game that blends the systemic depth of *Rust*, the building logic of *Minecraft*, and a fully unique world made from colorful, eye-pleasing spheres.

---

## 🎮 Core Concept

**Nebulark** reimagines voxel survival by replacing cubes with **soft, colored spheres** of varying sizes. Players explore a beautiful, organic world filled with spherical terrain, stylized trees, bubble-like structures, and modular environments. The goal: survive, thrive, and shape the world — together.

## 🛠️ Game Features

### 🌍 World Structure
- Everything is built from **spheres** instead of cubes.
- Spheres vary in **size, material, and color**, offering visually rich and readable environments.
- The terrain is **procedurally generated** using noise algorithms to create hills, rivers, caves, and biome transitions.

### 🔧 Survival Mechanics
- Players start with nothing and must **gather, craft, and build**.
- Features **hunger, health, and stamina** systems.
- Day/night cycle and weather-based survival layers (cold biomes, heat zones).
- Build using spheres: bases, farms, machines, defenses.

### 👥 Multiplayer
- Server-based play (Mirror or Fish-Networking).
- Persistent worlds with player-placed structures and sphere modifications.
- Public or private server support.
- Optional PvP and raiding systems.

### 🌱 Farming & Resources
- Grow food spheres on crafted soil patches.
- Harvest sphere-based crops and raise wildlife.
- Resource spheres (wood, stone, ore) scattered across biomes.

### 🏗️ Building & Crafting
- Modular building system using sphere components.
- Snap-to-grid or freeform placement.
- Tools and machines crafted from collected resources.

## 🎨 Visual Style

- Low-poly, minimalistic design with smooth edges and bright, harmonious colors.
- All game elements — terrain, trees, structures, items — are stylized as spheres.
- Calm and readable aesthetic that appeals to adults and casual players alike.
